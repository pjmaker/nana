* Installing GNU Nana.

GNU Nana uses autoconf style automatic configuration and thus follows the
standard [./configure; make; make install] model of system
administration. For example try something like:

% gzcat nana-2.3.tar.gz | tar xvf - 	# extract archive
% cd nana-2.3

% ./configure				# possibly with --prefix=$HOME/play
or
% I_DEFAULT=fast ./configure		# just use single instructions
					# when an assert fail is detected
					# rather than printing a message
% make 	
% make install 				# and finally install it
% make check				# run self-testing code

% make check-mail 			# send check output off to nana-bug
                                        # *** Please do this step!
or
% make MAILER=elm check-mail		# if your mailer doesn't handle -s

% make subscribe			# subscribe to the nana mailinglist
					# for new version information, etc

More details can be found in INSTALL.con and in the info documentation
supplied with the distribution.  You might also wish to look at the
patch file for gdb which stops all those annoying breakpoint inserted
messages (see gdb/quiet.diff).

			Good Luck
