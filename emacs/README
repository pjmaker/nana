nana/emacs - some very early prototypes for a log mode in emacs.

The fess.el mode is intended as a tool for analysing the debugging
output of a program. The current prototype provides the ability to
show and hide lines by regular expressions in emacs.

The basic usage is:

C-C C-h hide lines by regexp
C-C C-s show lines by regexp
C-C *   show all lines

*Warning*: this code is mainly to inspire someone else to do it 
	properly. I know it breaks coding guidelines, has 	
	a few minor bugs and sometimes kills people.
	I had a look at some of the other modes to see
	if I could get the same effect and failed.

* What to add?

A proper version would include the ability to use another program
to select line visibility, e.g.

(fess-show "awk '$3 > 100 {print NR}'")

Where column 3 represents nuclear reactor temperature.

(fess-show <lisp-predicate>) - using a boolean elisp function?
		we'd probably also need some awk like functions
		in elisp (e.g. (field 3)).

The indirect buffers in emacs-20 would allow us to maintain
multiple views of the same data set.

Notes for a production version:

	0. Might also be useful for looking at syslog output.
	1. Perhaps put in time limitations for time stamped messsages.
	   messages from t..u only allowed.
