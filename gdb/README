nana/gdb - some gdb commands and patches for various obscure purposes.

quiet.diff - patch for 4.16 which adds a --quiet-breakpoints option
	which stops all those "Breakpoint set at " messages which be
	can be a bit tiresome if your setting a large number of breakpoints.
	(-silent, -quiet and -batch don't seem to stop this).

nana-trace - produce a line by line trace of the execution of a program.
nana-libtrace - produce a GDB script from a library which traces
	all calls to a particular set of library files.

Note 0: gdb-4.16 seems to have a few problems with single stepping ,
      you might want to try gdb-4.17 does a bit better in this respect.
      
Note 1: gdb-4.17 also implements tracepoints which should perhaps
        be used for this sort of thing. They don't seem to be documented
	yet, use help tracepoints for more information in gdb.

** OLD stuff that should be reimplemented if anyone is interested
nana-trace-calls - produce function call trace of the execution of a program.
nana-coverage - produce a code coverage list (code vs # of times executed)
nana-coverage-calls - as nana-coverage except on a per call basis
