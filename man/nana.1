.TH NANA 1
.SH NAME 
nana - generates debugger commands from C and C++ source code
.SH SYNOPSIS
nana [cpp-flags] files...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Generates gdb(1) commands from the arguments
which implement the assertion and
logging operations specified by macros such as DI(3) and DL(3). 
The output of nana(1) can then be sourced into gdb(1) to perform these
operations. 

Note that you must provide any C preprocessor flags you are using to
nana since these can change the code that is generated by the compiler.
.SH SEE ALSO
nana-clg(1), nana(3), I(3), DI(3), L(3), DL(3), Q(3) and nana.info.

The nana.info file is the primary documentation.
