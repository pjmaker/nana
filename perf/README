perf - Nana Performance Measurement.

This directory contains some tools for generating basic space/time reports
for the nana library (or other code for that matter). It is not particularly
tidy (understatement!) and probably isn't very portable. However if you are
interested in such things as which optimisation flags make a difference
it may be of interest. 

The test code is stored in *.tst and the tests themselves are
performed by doing a "make perf".
