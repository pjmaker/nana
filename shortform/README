Nana Shortform Generator.

* What is a short form.
"Eiffel speak" for the code minus the implementation, i.e we list
function types, arguments and the preconditions, postconditions.

* What does it do.
Produce a listing of your functions with pre/post conditions in HTML
(a summary of the code).

* What do you need to get this to work.
A separate source code to HTML generator is required. Currently we use
the GLOBAL package which is available from Shigio Yamaguchi at
http://wafu.netgate.net/tama/unix/global.html or at a FreeBSD archive
(www.<country>.freebsd.org). A huge variety of other translators
exist on the internet, see the documentation for more suggestions.

* How do I test it.
Just run make example in this directory and then look at HTML/index.html
