Sun Apr 27 07:18:16 1997  Phil Maker  <pjm@chingiz.cs.ntu.edu.au>

	* Added nana-eiffel-commands and nana-print-classes to
	support the eiffel.h work.

Wed Jun 19 23:17:57 1996  Phil Maker  <pjm@morinda.cs.ntu.edu.au>

	* Added an nana-run-init.gdb script which gets called before
	all the the user gdb scripts in nana-run. Without this the
	debugger can set waiting for a newline since it turns on
	pagination by default. This file just turns pagination and
	questioning off before the breakpoints are loaded.
