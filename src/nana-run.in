# nana-run.in - run a program under the debugger and filter out the useless
#	messages. The filtering should actually be done in the gdb program
#	but -quiet etc don't seem to turn of all messages. Perhaps add
#	set print-off/on commands to gdb.
#
# usage:
#
#	% nana-run a.out -x main.gdb
#
#
#       NANARUN_GDB_OPTIONS - environment variable containing arguments to 
#         pass off to gdb.
